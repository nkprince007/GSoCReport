bio: >
 I'm a final year student of Computer Science & Engineering at University School of Information,
 Communication & Technology, GGS IP University. I participated in GSoC and worked with [coala](coala.io) to facilitate users to use coala online. I also worked on a bot to create coafile (coala configuration file), worked on improving UI of coala-html and configurability of coala-projects. I also worked on adding Notification and Thread support in the IGitt library.
